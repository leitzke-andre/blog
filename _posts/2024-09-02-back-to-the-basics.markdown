... aaaand I'm back.

After blog-hopping in between Jekyll (hosted in Github Pages), Wordpress (self-hosted) and (Bear)[https://bearblog.dev], I am now back to Jekyll, except that now I'm hosting directly on Cloudflare Pages.

The reason for this is simple: Jekyll is simple and comfy, and I find it easier to put things in writing in a text editor than a web interface, even if it comes with the additional overhead of having to push stuff to git. On the bright side, maybe this helps me have some more green squares on my graph - not that I've blogged much.

About blogging frequency: honestly most of last year was done in survival mode, things have been a rollercoaster with return to software development, trip to Brazil, layoff, German course, return to software development part II, and I hope that now, having passed the probational period in my new job, I will finally be able to actually breathe and think clearly for a bit again.

As always, this is more a space for notes and self-reflection. If anyone else reading this can take something from here that is awesome, but I cannot guarantee the value of the contents to anyone else except for myself.
